# FizzBuzz
A quick program inspired by Tom Scott's video on it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK\_wsc)

## Description
I tried to make this code as future-proof as I could.  It's not amazing but it got the job done.

## Licensing
If for some reason you want to use my code:

1. Don't, it's not great
2. Please credit me somewhere as staplertime and/or link to my github :)
